# Node.js-Backend-Application

Thanks for giving me an oppurtunity to become in a test of choosing intern program. In order to show my current skills. I chose, the second question which is creating a node.js backend end application for weather app.

First of all I created a code for storing the user details such as first name, lastname, email and location in a mongoDB database. In this backend we can use all CRUD functionalities about user details which is coded in user controller.js. The all the 4 functions and try catch block has been applied in order to find errors in code, if error occurs it sends message as code"404" if function is success it says the code"200". In app js the weather API is applied to in order to find the current weather information about the given or specific user locations in order to get their current location weather details. The variables and type of variables for users are mentioned in models/User.js and routes for the functionalties are given routes/user-routes.js. But still it lacks to work the send emails for 3 hours condition.
This was a new challenge for me and I learned a lot in this challenge. Maybe I wasnt able to finish the assignment for now but I will learn and improve my coding skills after this experience.As for now all I can give you a proper working user backend. I am honored to participate in a test of codescale intern. In order to test user backend http://localhost:5000/user/.

Thank you.
